Ok so clicking works now. Here's the plaaaaaannnn

1. Make a function that will decide whether to print the
individual table icons stuff based on money,
just do a rect with an image and text ont top

2. Make each image intractable, by keeping track of how many,
and also subtracting that amount from your cookies
(formulas for what the exchange rate is)

3. Have cookies grow and increase on their own.

4. Find out the overarching formulas for cookies gained without action,
and cookies gained from clicking



Final polish:
Wiggling cookie
that's about it lol
