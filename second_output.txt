sooo all of this happened on october 30th but i'm only now writing about it on november 10thn

after many months of scheduling, my dnd party elandry, jacob, dale, tanner, and joseph) had finally found a day that would work to run curse of strahd ecos)n
the date was today, one day before halloweenn

joseph asked if he could bring his xbox to show me the new destiny expansion, i said suren when he came he asked where he could plug it in, i said we should use my monitor but he said we had to use the tvn i plugged it in and we started playingn i did a bit but it eventually turned into him just playing destiny on our tvn i was a bit annoyed at the time but really didn't mindn i tried to prepare as much as i could for the campaignn

eventually tanner arrived, i asked joseph if he could turn off his game, it took around 10 minutes for him to actaully do itn slowly but surely everyone else arrived and we started to playn throughout the entirety of play joseph continously made funny noises, did some acrobatics on the coffee table, or showed me memes on his phonen i continously tried to ask him to focus but he didn'tn it honestly annoyed me, i had spent months preparing for this day and he was treating it terriblyn not only that but in game, his character is suspicously overpoweredn the 8 year old girl he's playing is better then everyone else's charactern

at around 5j00, pizza arrivedn we all went up to eatn everyone was up there for about 30 minutesn we talked, and ate a lot of pizzan except josephn after around one slice he went back into the basementn once we finished talking and eating we went down and found him playing destiny eon the tv where i had everything set up)n not only that but he had pulled all of my socks from under the couchn he also pulled out the neatly organized cables for our speaker systemn at this point i was incredibly annoyed and a little angryn i got him to turn off destiny and to start playingn you can read the summary of our game in the session summary foldern

i never really audbily get mad at anyone, i'm a bit of a pushover in that sensen

after joseph and landry left, we drove to seth's house for his partyn i have a couple pictures in the photos foldern

the party was pretty crazyn we all gathered in his basement and played gamesn most of my friends from oak canyon were there, it was greatn after a bit we went into his backyard to play 9 squaren i actually enjoyed itn i'm not going to go into detail on everything we did but all of it was funn this really made me think about the friends i haven i genuinly love all of my friends, and i really felt cared about in that roomn normally i feel really out of place due to my weight, but i actually felt really comfortable at seth's partyn

one of the people at the party was talann he is literally the nicest person i known i actually want to cry when i'm around himn he always greets me with a smile and hug whenever i see himn ei'm actually on the verge of crying while writing this)n

the final thing that happened at the party was interestingn seth has a little movie room that some people started to talk inn eventually people were referring to it as ithe roomi or ithe drama roomin people would all go in and close the door and then start talking about all the drama that's been going onn i never actually shared anything, i was mostly just there on the couchn people started talking about dating, and romantic relationshipsn i still haven't truly had a crush on anyone, so i didn't know what to think of itn it made me realise that people are actaually dating now that we are in highschooln i'm planning on never getting involved with itn

that day was very bign when i got home i was dead tiredn
eprobably the largest entry i will write for a while)
